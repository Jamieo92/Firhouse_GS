            The VIK Gran Hotel Costa del Sol 4* is a four-star hotel on the Costa de Mijas. It is located on the Costa del Sol in a quiet area, just 11 km from Fuengirola and 20 km from Marbella.
            Spain is home to some of the best golf courses in Europe, so with that said i think it would be the perfect place to host our fisrt golf trip abroad. The weather is always nice so it would be great to get a trip during the cold Irish winter when it gets harder to play.
